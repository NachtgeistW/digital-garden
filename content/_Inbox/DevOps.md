DevOps is a set of practices combining software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). DevOps aims to streamline development and enable continuous delivery of high-quality software.

DevOps improves software development pipelines by [automating manual processes.](http://unity.com/solutions/what-is-ci-cd) This makes it easier to get code from development into production more quickly while maintaining code quality. Tools and technologies like version control for [source code management](https://unity.com/solutions/source-code-management) are part of DevOps, but the single most important component is cultural. 

DevOps requires close collaboration between development and operations teams, and encourages a willingness to experiment and learn from mistakes. Teams that practice DevOps can deliver software more rapidly and with fewer errors. [DevOps methodologies](https://unity.com/solutions/agile-vs-devops) are growing in popularity, particularly in industries where moving quickly is essential to remaining competitive.
