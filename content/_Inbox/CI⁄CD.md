CI/CD is an umbrella term covering several DevOps phases. CI (continuous integration) is the practice of integrating code changes into a repo several times a day. CD has two meanings: Continuous **delivery** automates code integrations, while continuous **deployment** auto-releases final builds to end-users. CI/CD’s frequent testing reduces code errors and defects, making it crucial to every [[DevOps]] workflow.

CI/CD 是一个涵盖多个 DevOps 阶段的总称。CI（持续集成）是每天多次将代码更改集成到代码仓库中的做法。CD 有两个含义：Continuous **Delivery**（持续交付）自动化代码集成，而 Continuous **Deployment**（持续部署）自动向终端用户发布最终构建。 CI/CD 的频繁测试减少了代码错误和缺陷，使其对每个 [[DevOps]] 工作流程都至关重要。
