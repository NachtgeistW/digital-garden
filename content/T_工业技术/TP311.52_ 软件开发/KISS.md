一种设计原则，是 Keep it simple, stupid! （保持简单，傻逼！）的缩写。

亦有删掉逗号的 keep it simple stupid 用法；以及把后面两个 S 换掉的用法，比如 keep it super simple。

In the programming context, there are a few points to note whenever we want to reduce complexity.

- Ensure your variable names describes the variable it holds properly.
- Ensure your method names translates to the purpose of that method.
- Write comments within your method where necessary.
- Ensure your classes has a single responsibility.
- Avoid global states and behaviors like as much as you can.
- Delete instances, methods or redundant processes within the code base that are not in use.
