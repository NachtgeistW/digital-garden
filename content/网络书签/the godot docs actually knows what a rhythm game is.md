thoughts on godot so far: holy shit someone who wrote the godot docs actually knows what a rhythm game is and why this matters for NOISZ SL (unity) I had to do a lot of "figure it out on your own !ðŸ¤“" but in spite of that I'm pretty happy with how well SL sync holds up

I did, but I did not participate in the document, for godot I use my own audio system based on the great miniaudio [https://github.com/EIRTeam/godot/tree/shinobu_gd4/modules/shinobu](https://t.co/9nEABoj8T3)
