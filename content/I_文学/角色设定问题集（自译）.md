原文：[角色设定问题集（自译） - 文章 (weibo.com)](https://weibo.com/p/1001603844885093438956?mod=zwenzhang)

---

很久以前翻译的一篇东西。个人认为，有这个问题集作一个指引还是挺好的，在作者对角色的性格感到模糊的时候，它能帮作者思考，从而为角色赋予更完整的人格。而且就算不设计人物，自己回答回答这些问题也蛮有趣的-v-

问题集  
  
1、如果你的人物今晚就得死，而且来不及跟其他人说什么了，他最后悔的事是没跟谁说什么东西？为什么他一直没跟那人说？  
  
2、你的人物会不会以接受1百万现金为代价离开当前的国家、并永远不再回来？  
  
3、你的人物被赋予了一项特殊技能：只要想着一个人的死、并重复说两次“再见”，那人就真的会死。死者会死于自然原因，没人会怀疑你的人物。那么你的人物会在什么情况下用这种能力？（或：如果你的人物在脑海里想过要杀掉谁，在亲自面对那个人并与他目光对接之后，你的人物还会不会真的杀掉他？你的人物有没有特别想杀掉谁或希望谁去死？）  
  
4、对你的人物而言，怎样的夜晚算是一个“完美的夜晚”？  
  
5、你的人物愿意选择事业有成私生活平淡，还是个人生活丰富多彩事业平平？（很多人都想要愉快的个人生活，但大家为什么还是花大把心血在职场上？如果你的人物觉得私生活更加重要，那么他会不会真以个人生活为最优先？还是说他只是不想承认工作更重要？他们是否用工作作为逃避的手段？他们是否希望能通过事业的成功换来个人的幸福？）  
  
6、如果你的人物明早醒来便能获得一项能力或特质，他希望获得什么？  
  
7、你的人物将有机会遇到一个完美的梦中情人，两人能产生出最热烈的感情。但遗憾的是，这个人在六个月之后就会死去。既然已经知道事后的痛苦，你的人物是否仍然愿意跟那人一见、并坠入情网？如果那个人六个月之后不会死，而是会背叛呢？（在爱情方面，你的人物更看重的是电光石火还是天长地久？他希望爱自己的人能给自己什么？当他的情人做出什么事的时候，他会觉得是被背叛了——漠不关心、不诚实、不忠？）  
  
8、你的人物希望做男人还是做女人？他们要好的朋友们多是男性还是女性？  
  
9、如果杀掉一个无辜者能让全世界免于饥荒，你的人物会不会去杀这个人？（一个无辜的生命死在自己手上，或知道成百上千人的死是因为自己，这两种情况哪个更让你的角色痛苦？你的角色对为达成伟大目标而放弃了自己原则的人有何看法？如果他愿意牺牲自己，却不愿意夺走他人性命，那么是否有什么事会重要到让他甘愿一死？）  
  
10、你的人物最珍视的回忆是什么？  
  
11、如果你的人物知道一周之后会爆发核战，他会做什么？  
  
12、你的人物迄今为止最伟大的成就是什么？他是否希望能做更伟大的事？  
  
13、在遇到火灾时，你的人物最会去抢救/带出的一件物品是什么？  
  
14、你的人物遇到如下情境：在面前有十把手枪，只有一把里有子弹。他要挑一把枪，对自己额头扣下扳机。如果他挑的是空枪，他就能获得1百万现金。他会冒这个险吗？  
  
15、如果你的人物能选择自己死亡的方式，他会如何选择？（英勇就义、作为某个大事件的殉难者，还是平静而终？为什么大家都倾向于“在睡眠中安详死去”？）  
  
16、在你的人物的生命里，他们最感激的是什么？  
  
17、你的人物是否心胸宽大/容易释怀？  
  
18、当你的人物要讲一个故事的时候，他们会不会把这个故事夸大/修饰？如果会，那么为什么？  
  
19、你的人物觉得他对自己的人生把握/控制的程度是多高？  
  
20、当需要援手的时候，你的人物会去跟别人求助吗？  
  
21、你的人物是否喜欢当名人？什么样的名人？  
  
22、你的人物最难以舍弃的习惯是什么？他是否经常为了摆脱这个/这些习惯而挣扎？  
  
23、你的人物在为什么而努力奋斗：成就、安全、爱情、力量、激情、知识，还是其它什么？  
  
24、你的人物是不是很容易感到尴尬？  
  
25、如果你的人物从未做过某件事，那这件事对他而言是会更有吸引力还是会更不想让他做？

Brief Life Story  
  
It is very important to write a biography for your character.  The more detail you create, the deeper you can make your character, and this rich history will be such a rich source of information that it will change and evolve your story accordingly.  
  
Make sure to keep in mind:  
-  How did your character get here from there?  
-  What was their life like before the story began?  
-  What was growing up like for them?  
-  Did they have a good or bad childhood?  
-  What struggles have that had, or hardships they have overcome?  
-  Has their life worked out like they expected?  
-  Has their life been difficult or easy until now?   
-  Were they forced into their current path, or are they here by choice?  
-  Do they have regrets?  
-  What special circumstances have made them into who they are today?  
-  Did anything happen in their past that they cannot forget or live down, or that has deeply changed them or scarred them in some way? (warning: do not create cheap Freudian backstory as motivation for your characters! i.e. "His mother beat him as a child, and now he hates all women." "She was once robbed at gunpoint, and now has a irrational fear of guns." People are more complex than this.  If such a traumatic event happened in their lives, then make the psychological or emotional consequence unexpected rather than exactly what any five-year-old would instantly assume.)

From The Book of Questions  
  
A further source of great questions to ask your characters is the brilliant work The Book of Questions.  This is filled with juicy and thought-provoking questions that explore personal philosophy, morality, politics, knee-jerk reactions, secret fantasies, wishes, and much more.  It's also a great party activity to sit around with your friends and pass the book around as you each take turns selecting questions for all to answer.  
  
A. If your character were to die this evening with no opportunity to communicate with anyone, what would they most regret not having told someone? Why haven't they told them yet?  
  
B. Would your character accept $1,000,000 to leave the county and never set foot in it again?  
  
C. Your character is given the power to kill people simply by thinking of their deaths and twice repeating the word "good-bye." People would die a natural death and no one would suspect them. Are there any situations in which they would use this power? [If they can imagine themselves killing someone indirectly, could they still see doing it if they had to look into the person's eyes and stab the person to death? Have they ever genuinely wanted to kill someone or wished them dead?]  
  
D. What would constitute a "perfect" evening for your character?  
  
E. Would your character rather be extremely successful professionally and have a tolerable yet unexciting private life, or have an extremely happy private life and only a tolerable and uninspiring professional life? [Since so many people place great emphasis on a happy private life, why do people often wind up putting more energy into their professional lives? If you feel that their private life is more important to your character, do their priorities support this? Are they simply unwilling to admit that work is more important? Do they use work as a substitute? Do they hope professional success will somehow magically lead to personal happiness?]  
  
F. If your character could wake up tomorrow having gained any one ability or quality, what would it be?  
  
G. Your character has the chance to meet someone with whom they can have the most satisfying love imaginable - the stuff of dreams. Sadly, they know that in six months the person will die. Knowing that pain that would follow, would they still want to meet that person and fall in love? What if they knew their lover would not die, but instead would betray them? [In love, is intensity or permanence more important to them? How much do they expect from someone who loves them? What would make them feel betrayed by their mate - indifference? Dishonesty? Infidelity?  
  
H. Does your character prefer being around men or women? Do their closest friends tend to be men or women?  
  
I. Would your character be willing to murder an innocent person if it would end hunger in the world? [Would it torment them more to have the blood of an innocent person on their hands or to know they let millions of people die? What do they think of people who achieve great things by compromising their principles? Many are will to give their own lives but not to take the life of another; is anything so important they would sacrifice their very soul for it?]  
  
J. What is their most treasured memory?  
  
K. If your character knew there would be a nuclear war in one week, what would they do?  
  
L. What is the greatest accomplishment of your character's life? Is there anything they hope to do that is even better?  
  
M. One would be the one material item your character would save during a fire?  
  
N. Your character is offered $1,000,000 for the following act: before them are ten pistols - only one of which is loaded. They must pick up one of the pistols, point it at their forehead, and pull the trigger. If they can walk away they do so a millionaire. Would they accept the risk?  
  
O. If your character could choose the manner of their death, what would it be? [Would they die a hero's death, die a martyr to some great cause, die in a natural catastrophe, or die peacefully? Why is it so tempting to have death catch us in our sleep?]  
  
P. For what in your character's life do they feel most grateful?  
  
Q. How forgiving is your character?  
  
R. When your character tells a story, do they often exaggerate or embellish it? If so, why?  
  
S. How much does your character feel in control of the course of their life?  
  
T. Is it easy for your character to ask for help when they need it? Will they ask for help?  
  
U. Would your character like to be famous? In what way?  
  
V. What are your character's most compulsive habits? Do they regularly struggle to break those habits?  
  
W. What does your character strive for most in their life: accomplishment, security, love, power, excitement, knowledge, or something else?  
  
X. How easily embarrassed is your character?  
  
Y. Does the fact that your character has never done something before increase or decrease its appeal to them?  
  
Z. How many different sexual partners has your character had in their life? Would they prefer to have had more or fewer?
